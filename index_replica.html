            <h2>1. Italian soda at Bytes</h2>
            <p><strong>Near Block A, CCT IDC,</strong> Sector 26</p>
            <p>When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me, but I wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and became reacquainted with the combination of fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask; I haven’t tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop alternative for the times when you’re feeling a refreshing drink that doesn’t have caffeine or milk.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Raspberry Italian soda</p>

            <h2>2. Bubble tea at Pop Tea Bar</h2>
            <p><strong>Near Block A, CCT IDC,</strong> Sector 35</p>
            <p>Monday's a usually groan-worthy day of the week. The lockers are done well with a mixture of wooden cargo displays with classic old books on either side of the window area modestly shaded with a broken frame...</p>
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Classic Milk Tea with tapioca & an order of popcorn chicken.</p>

            <p><strong>Near Block A, CCT IDC,</strong> Sector 34</p>
            <p>I can’t tell you whether CoHo has a particularly amazing Vanilla Bean Latte, only because CoHo is the only place I’ve ever ordered a Vanilla Bean Latte from...</p>
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Vanilla Bean Latte</p>

            <p><strong>Near Block A, CCT IDC,</strong> Sector 29</p>
            <p>Nexus Cafe has a lot of lovely things packed into its cafeteria space, including agua fresca! Grab a cup of this fresh and fruity beverage before you head to the check out line...</p>
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Agua Fresca</p>
